# This project is intended to function with PHP 8.2 and PostgreSQL 15

Personally, I prefer phpPgAdmin over any other PostgreSQL UI tools due to its similarity to phpMyAdmin, which brings a sense of familiarity. Unfortunately, it appears that the developers behind this great tool have abandoned the project. Moreover, I am reluctant to run PHP 7 on my PC solely to support this tool. Therefore, my objective is to ensure full compatibility with PHP 8.2. I'm open to your PRs, so lets make this phpPgAdmin great again :)

## to run using php embedded HTTP server:
`php -S localhost:8800`
